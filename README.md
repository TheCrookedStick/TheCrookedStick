## Welcome to The Crooked Stick's Github page.  
I have no idea what I'm doing.   I'm trying to become proficient in GitHub...but for now, I'm like a hungry, sleep deprived toddler with a dirty diaper.   I'm stupid, frustrated and stinking up the place.   Hopefully I figure it out before I smash my computer   ðŸ‘‹
